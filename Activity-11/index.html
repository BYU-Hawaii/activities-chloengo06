            <h2>What is Lungs Cancer? </h2>
            <p>Lung cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the cells of the lungs, typically in the lining 
                of the air passages. It is characterized by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells, forming tumors 
                that can interfere with normal lung function. There are two main types: non-small cell lung cancer 
                and small cell lung cancer, each with distinct characteristics and treatment approaches. Symptoms 
                of lung cancer may include persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing up 
                blood. Early detection through screening and prompt medical intervention are crucial for improving 
                outcomes in lung cancer patients.</p>

            <h2>Lungs cancer and smoke</h2>
            <p>Lung cancer and smoking cigarettes are deeply intertwined, with smoking being the leading cause 
                of this deadly disease. The carcinogenic substances present in cigarette smoke, such as tar and 
                nicotine, directly damage the cells lining the lungs over time, increasing the risk of cancer 
                development. Studies have consistently shown that smokers are far more likely to develop lung 
                cancer compared to non-smokers, with the risk escalating with the duration and intensity of 
                smoking.</p>

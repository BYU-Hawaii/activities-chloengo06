        <h1>CHLOE NGO</h1>
        <h3>Hi, I'm <i>Chloe Ngo</i>, a dedicated student passionate about learning and exploring new things.</h3>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing my degree in accounting, with a keen interest in computer science and film.</p>
        <p>Aside from academics, I also have a creative side. I love experimenting with makeup and creating unique looks. Makeup allows me to express myself and unleash my creativity.</p>

        <h3>MORE ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>My parents have two daughters and one son. I am the youngest of the three. My father and my brother are farmers, my sister is a CPA, and my mother is the owner of a small shop.</p>    
        <p id="targetParagraph">I will graduate in Fall 2026, I have not done much after my highschool besides attending some clubs, having fun, and discovering what are my passions as well as goals in my life.</p>
        <p> I hope that I can also open a business in the future. I am from Vietnam so I want to live there when I retire, maybe around 40 or 50. Vietnam is a great country, a lot of warm people and good food. Itâ€™s great to live there, especially when you retire.</p>
        <abbr> My name also carries a pretty meaning: Binh Ngo = "My Vietnamese name, which means living a peaceful and blessing life"</abbr>
        <p> In my journey, I've learned that Learning by Doing is the most effective way to acquire new skills. It's important to <em>embrace challenges</em> and <strong>persevere through difficulties</strong> to achieve your goals. Remember to always stay <sub>humble</sub> and keep learning.</p>
